### Why am I taking 262
I am taking 262 because I am interested in taking the environmental modeling class in the spring. I am currently taking energy demand analysis and am buildig energy models on excel. I am really enjoying this and would love to learn how to build more complex models using R. 
### Data Science Background
I do not have a lot of experience coding. All of my experience comes from 206. I have used other systems such as GIS, Excel, and Google Earth Engine to analyze and solve environmental problems. I look forward to growing my coding skills in this course.
